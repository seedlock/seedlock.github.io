## Device Naming

For added security you can choose to use a secret name in conjunction with your password. Doing so means that your seedphrase cannot be restored unless your device is set to the secret name. For instance, if the regular device name is "Alice's iPhone" it can be temporarily changed to "secret name" and then used when entering a seedphrase. Once the seedphrase is successfully entered the name can be changed back to "Alice's iPhone". From there on it will not be possible to restore the seedphrase unless the device name is set to "secret name".

***Steps to take***

1. Go to settings/general/about/name
2. Change the name (Be sure that it is something that you will never forget).
3. Follow the wallet entry instructions.
4. After a successful wallet entry change back to the original name.
